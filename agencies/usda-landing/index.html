                    <p>The goal of the Democratizing Data Initiative is to enable different communities to understand
                        how government data assets are used.</p>

                    <p>One way to build this understanding is through usage dashboards. Each dashboard on the right
                        draws from a database that describes how National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) - USDA
                        data assets are referenced in research publications.</p>

                    <p>The database links mentions of National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) - USDA data assets
                        in research publications with the research topics of those publications, the publication
                        authors, and their affiliated institutions.</p>

                    <p>Please note that this pilot project only reflects the information associated with the datasets
                        requested by the agency for the project and is not intended to find all references to all
                        datasets and data assets produced or supported by the agency.</p>
