        Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018: Who Is Using the Data?</a></h3>

    <p><b>Nancy Potok</b></p>

    <p dir="ltr">In this<a href="https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/effective-policy-learning" target="_blank"> Effective
        Policy Learning</a> piece, the author, Nancy Potok, a Visiting Fellow at RTI International, describes how the<a
        href="{{ site.baseurl }}/"> Democratizing Data Search and Discovery Platform</a> is making great strides in helping meet the
      mandates of the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 (Evidence Act) and demonstrating the value
      of federal data. The act encourages federal agencies to improve the way they use data for evidence-based
      decision-making. It emphasizes the importance of data sharing, data transparency, and data accessibility across
      government agencies. To discover who is using federal data, the search and discovery platform allows agencies to
      track metrics through machine learning and language models to gain a deeper understanding of use. This column is
      an introduction to a deeper dive exploring the collection and value of usage data that will be published in a
      special HDSR issue, “Democratizing Data: Data as a Public Asset,” planned for spring 2024.</p>

        A Manifesto</a></h3>

    <p><strong>Julia Lane</strong><br>
      Public data are foundational to our democratic system. People need consistently high-quality information from
      trustworthy sources. In the new economy, wealth is generated by access to data; government's job is to democratize
      the data playing field. Yet data produced by the American government are getting worse and costing more. In
      Democratizing Our Data, Julia Lane argues that good data are essential for democracy. Her book is a wake-up call
      to America to fix its broken public data system.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/g6e8noiy/release/2" target="_blank">Data Inventories for the Modern
        Age? Using Data Science to Open Government Data
      </a></h3>

    <p><strong>Julia Lane, Ernesto Gimeno, Ekaterina Levitskaya, Zheyuan Zhang, and Alberto Zigoni
      </strong><br>
      This article describes how data science techniques—machine learning and natural language processing—can be used to
      open the black box of government data. It then describes how an incentive structure can be established—using
      human–computer interaction techniques —to create a new and sustainable data ecosystem. The particular focus is on
      the United States and on scientific researchers, who are major users of government data. However, the approach can
      be deployed to other use cases, such as data mentions in newspapers and government reports, and many other
      countries.
